## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js with ViteJS to demonstrate my skills in building modern web applications. (Using Next.js or Astro would have been a better choice for this project to achieve higher performance with Static Site Generation (SSG) and improved SEO)
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and better long-term maintenance
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS because it is modern, fast to configure and use, and ideal for quickly creating responsive designs
- **Data Management**: JSON, the simplicity of the data and the frequency of updates justify the use of these simple files
- **Containerization**: Docker to ensure simpler and isolated deployment
